# Core Concepts

## Vectors

`renature` uses two-dimensional vectors as the core data type for running our physics simulations. [Vectors](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-1-vectors/) are mathematical objects that have both magnitude and direction, and are typically represented in two dimensions using a directed line.

When modeling real-world motion in two dimensions, vectors are particularly useful. We can use vectors to represent where an object is in space (which we call `position` in `renature`), how fast an object is moving through space (`velocity`), and the rate of change of its speed (`acceleration`). `renature` tracks all of these vectors in animation state when running our physics simulations to keep track of how objects move over time.

We use [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/) to model vectors in `renature`, using a data structure called a [tuple](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/tuple).

```reason
/* A moving object located at x: 5m, y: 10m in our coordinate system. */
let position = (5., 10.);

/* An object moving at -0.5m/s in the x direction and 2m/s in the y direction. */
let velocity = (-0.5, 2.);

/* An object decelerating at -0.1 m/s^2 in the x direction and 0.005 m/s^2 in the y direction. */
let acceleration = (-0.1, 0.005);
```

Forces can be modeled as vectors as well. Forces have a magnitude (how strong the force is) and a direction (the path the force is following).

```reason
let force = (-5., -2.);
```

With this knowledge of a set of motion vectors and a force vector, we can determine how applying a force onto a moving object will alter that object's `acceleration`, `velocity`, and `position` vectors. To do that, we use the following equations from Newtonian physics.

**Force equals mass times acceleration.**

**Therefore, acceleration equals force divided by mass.**

**The velocity of an object is equal to its current velocity plus acceleration times time.**

**The position, or displacement, of an object is equal to its current position plus velocity times time.**

With just these laws, we can build a comprehensive model of motion in two dimensions. To learn more, check out Daniel Shiffman's excellent writing on [Vectors](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-1-vectors/) or read [the source](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/blob/master/src/core/Vector.re) for our vector math.

## From To Style Animations

`renature`'s core hooks, like `useGravity`, `useFriction`, and `useFluidResistance`, operate on the notion of animating **from** a specific CSS state (i.e. `opacity: 0`) **to** a new CSS state (i.e. `opacity: 1`). In this way, the API is quite similar to [`react-spring`](https://www.react-spring.io/) and even traditional CSS transitions. The difference is in the physics we use to determine how you get from one state to another.

Each force in `renature` has its own character and produces its own style of motion; depending on the effect you're trying to achieve, one force might be better suited for your needs than another. However, every force uses the same notion of a `mover` object (the object experiencing the force in our simulation) and a `force` vector. By applying the `force` vector to the `mover` object, we can determine the `position` of the mover at the current time.

We then determine where this `position` lies along the whole trajectory of the moving object's path (see how we determine this path in the **Simulate** section below). Is the mover halfway to its target destination? Two thirds of the way? This information helps us to determine what percentage "done" the animation is. It's almost like a physics-based version of a [tween](https://inventingwithmonster.io/20190304-how-to-write-a-tween/).

Finally, we use a technique called [linear interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation) to map this progress to your CSS state. For example, if the `mover` is halfway along its total trajectory, and you're animating from `opacity: 0` to `opacity: 1`, we know that the current `opacity` in this particular frame should be `0.5`. Check out the diagrams below to see a visual representation of the connections between our simulation and interpolation steps.

## The Lifecycle of an Animation

The lifecycle of an animation in `renature` can be thought of as occuring in three stages:

- **Simulate**
- **Interpolate**
- **Animate**

We discuss these phases in detail below.

### Simulate

The first step in a `renature` animation is to start the backing physics simulation in the `requestAnimationFrame` loop. This is what allows us to expose our `mover` object to the selected `force` vector. We then observe the changing `position` of the `mover` object over time as the `force` acts on it.

To track the `position` of the mover we use a standard Cartesian coordinate system, with the mover always beginning at the origin (0, 0). We also determine, before the animation ever runs, the ending position for the `mover`. This ending position varies force by force, and is based off a particular physics condition achieved by our simulations.

### The Gravity Simulation

For gravity, the backing simulation involves a `mover` object being pulled towards an `attractor` object. The `mover` is assumed to start at rest, gradually accelerating as it gets pulled towards the `attractor`. To simplify the simulation, we only apply the gravitational force of the `attractor` on the `mover`. Once the `mover` has reached the `attractor`, we end the simulation and stop the animation. At this point, your animating element will have reached the `to` CSS state specified in your configuration.

### The Friction Simulation

For `useFriction`, the backing simulation involves a `mover` object sliding across a rough surface. The `mover` is assumed to have an initial velocity, provided by the user configuration. We also account for the strength of the normal force in this simulation using the acceleration of gravity at Earth's surface (roughly 9.80665 m/s²). Once the `mover` has come to rest on the surface (achieved `velocity` (0, 0)), we end the simulation and stop the animation. We use a variant of the [kinematic equations](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/one-dimensional-motion/kinematic-formulas/a/what-are-the-kinematic-formulas) to derive the `position` at which the `mover` will come to rest.

At this point, your animating element will have reached the `to` CSS state specified in your configuration.

### The Fluid Resistance Simulation

For `useFluidResistance`, the backing simulation involves dropping the `mover` object from rest into a fluid of density ρ. The `mover` object experiences the force of gravity acting at the Earth's surface in one direction and the force of drag in the other. As the `mover` continues to fall through the fluid, it will eventually reach [terminal velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_velocity), the speed at which the net acceleration on the `mover` is 0. At this point, your animating element will have reached the `to` CSS state specified in your configuration. For cases where the `settle` parameter is provided, reaching terminal velocity will actually result in the `mover` colliding with a surface and rebounding.

### Interpolate

Our physics simulations provide highly accurate `position` vectors and also set a **range** for the `mover`'s total trajectory. The **Interpolate** stage takes this information and maps it to an output **domain** represented by the `from` and `to` boundaries of your CSS property.

Let's look at an example. Say you want to animate your element using the `useGravity` hook. We determine the **range** of your animation by looking at the `r` parameter you provided to `useGravity`.

```typescript
const GravityBasic: React.FC = () => {
  const [props] = useGravity<HTMLDivElement>({
    from: { opacity: 0, transform: 'translateX(0px) scale(0.5)' },
    to: { opacity: 1, transform: 'translateX(100px) scale(2)' },
    config: {
      moverMass: 10000,
      attractorMass: 1000000000000,
      r: 75, // The range of the physics simulation will be (0, 75).
    },
  });

  return <div {...props} />;
};
```

We then look at the `from` and `to` properties you provided to `useGravity` and build an output **domain**. In the above example we have two (really three) output domains:

```
opacity = (0, 1);
transform - translateX = (0px, 100px);
transform - scale (0.5, 2);
```

Using linear interpolation, we can determine where along the `mover`'s path we are. Let's say we're at `position` 25, a third of the way to our ending position. With this information, we can interpolate a CSS value in each output **domain**.

```
opacity = 25 / 75 * (1 - 0) + 0 = 0.333;
transform - translateX = 25 / 75 * (100px - 0px) + 0px = 33.3px;
transform - scale = 25 / 75 * (2 - 0.5) + 0.5 = 1;
```

In this way we can interpolate a `position` in our physics simulation to a CSS value between user-supplied `from` and `to` states, smoothly animating your elements from one to the other. We run these calculations on every frame the browser paints inside `requestAnimationFrame`.

### Animate

The final step in a `renature` animation involves applying the interpolated CSS to your animating element. To do this we use a [mutable `ref` object](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref) and update its `style` property on every animation frame as we receive a new interpolated value (see above).

We use a mutable `ref` and the `style` property to avoid storing animation information in state. If we were triggering state updates on every frame, React would be attempting to re-render our component on every frame, quickly resulting in laggy, sluggish animations. While the reconciliation process is quite fast, it's not fast enough to give us a consistent 60fps.

This technique is used by similar libraries like `react-spring` and `animated`, although they vendor their own node type to handle a wider variety of render targets. `renature` currently operates on the web only.
