# Getting Started

In this section, we'll cover how to install `renature` and begin writing animations with the library.

- Check out [Your First Animation](./your-first-animation.md) to get your first animation working.
- Dive into controlling animations with the `Controller` API in [Controlling Animation States](./controlling-animation-states.md).
- Have questions? Check out our [FAQ](./faq.md).

## Installation

To begin using `renature`, install it from the package manager of your choice:

```bash
npm install --save renature
# or
yarn add renature
```

Also make sure you install its `peerDependencies`, `react` and `react-dom`, if you haven't already. You'll need to use a hooks compatible version of `react` and `react-dom`, i.e. `>=16.8.0`.

```bash
npm install --save react react-dom
# or
yarn add react react-dom
```

That's it! You're now ready to use `renature`.
