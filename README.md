# `renature`

`renature` is a physics-based animation library for React focused on modeling natural world forces like gravity, friction, and fluid dynamics, exposed as a set of React hooks.

## ✨Features

- 🎣 A small set of declarative React hooks for animating with ease.
- 🌌 Support for non-traditional physics-based animations using gravity, friction, fluid resistance, and more.
- 🧮 Mathematically accurate and type-safe physics, powered by [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/).
- 🔁 Start, stop, delay, and loop animations with our Controller API.
- 0️⃣ A tiny animation library with zero dependencies!
